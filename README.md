## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

-   **Node.js**: v18 or higher (includes npm)
-   **npm**: v9 or higher (or Yarn v1.22 or higher)
-   **Expo CLI**: Install globally via npm:
    ```bash
    npm install -g expo-cli
    ```

### Installation
To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Victormarshall911/COOUCart.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd COOUCart
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables
COOUCart relies on Supabase for its backend services. You need to configure your Supabase project and provide the necessary environment variables.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
2.  Add the following variables, replacing the placeholder values with your actual Supabase project URL and Anon Key:

    ```
    EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
    EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
    ```
    You can find these keys in your Supabase project settings under `API Settings`.

### Running the Application
Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are set, you can run the application:

```bash
npm run dev # or yarn dev
```
This command will launch the Expo Development Server in your web browser. From there, you can:
-   Scan the QR code with the **Expo Go** app on your iOS or Android device.
-   Run the app on an iOS simulator (requires Xcode) or Android emulator (requires Android Studio).
-   Open the app directly in your web browser (might have limited functionality for some native features).

## Usage

### User Roles
COOUCart provides two distinct user experiences based on the selected role during registration:

-   **Customer Account**: Designed for users who want to browse products, engage with sellers, and make purchases.
-   **Business Account**: Tailored for users who want to list their products, manage inventory, and interact with buyers.

### Registration and Login
When you first open the app, you will be directed to the authentication flow:
1.  **Sign Up**: Enter your full name, email, and a secure password. Crucially, select your account type: `Customer` or `Business`.
2.  **Login**: Use your registered email and password to sign into your account.

### As a Customer
-   **Discover Products**: On the home screen, browse a wide range of products. Use the integrated search bar to find specific items or apply filters by category and price range to refine your search.
-   **Detailed Product View**: Tap on any product to access its dedicated details page, showcasing the full description, current price, and information about the selling business, including its average rating.
-   **Initiate a Purchase**: If you're interested in a product, simply tap the "Buy Now" button on its details page. This action automatically creates a new chat thread with the seller, allowing you to discuss details before committing.
-   **Track Transactions**: Access the "My Transactions" section (via the shopping cart icon) to view a comprehensive list of all your ongoing and completed purchases.
-   **Chat with Sellers**: Engage in real-time conversations with businesses. Once a transaction is finalized (marked as `closed` by the business), you will have the opportunity to rate the business based on your experience.

### As a Business
-   **Manage Your Listings**: Navigate to the "My Products" tab to oversee all the items you currently have listed for sale. Here, you can easily add new products or remove existing ones.
-   **Add New Products**: Provide essential details such as the product title, a detailed description, the selling price, assign it to a category, and upload a compelling image to attract buyers.
-   **Customer Engagement**: The "Chats" tab is your hub for all conversations with potential buyers. Respond promptly to inquiries, negotiate terms, and provide excellent customer service.
-   **Finalize Transactions**: Within an active chat, once a deal is agreed upon and the transaction is complete, you can mark the chat status as "closed."
