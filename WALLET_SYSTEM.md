# Wallet System Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive in-app wallet system for your COOUCart marketplace app. The system includes:

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **Wallets Table**: Stores user wallet balances
- **Transactions Table**: Tracks all wallet transactions (deposits, withdrawals, payments, refunds)
- **Orders Table**: Manages purchase orders with wallet payments
- **Automatic Triggers**: Auto-creates wallets for new users and updates balances on transaction completion

### 2. Wallet Context (`contexts/WalletContext.tsx`)
- Centralized wallet state management
- Functions for funding, withdrawing, and making payments
- Real-time balance updates
- Transaction history management

### 3. Wallet Screen (`app/(tabs)/wallet.tsx`)
- Display current wallet balance
- Fund wallet functionality (simulated payment processing)
- Withdraw funds with account details
- Transaction history with status indicators
- Quick stats (total transactions, orders)

### 4. Payment Integration
- Updated product detail screen with wallet payment option
- Payment confirmation modal
- Insufficient balance handling with fund wallet redirect
- Order creation and tracking

### 5. Orders Screen (`app/(tabs)/orders.tsx`)
- Order history for customers
- Order status tracking (pending, paid, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- Product details in orders
- Action buttons for tracking and contacting sellers

### 6. Navigation Updates
- Added Wallet tab to main navigation
- Added Orders tab for customers
- Integrated WalletProvider in app layout

## Key Features

### For Customers:
- **Fund Wallet**: Add money to wallet balance
- **Withdraw Funds**: Transfer money to external accounts
- **Buy with Wallet**: Instant payments for products
- **Order Tracking**: View order status and history
- **Transaction History**: Complete transaction log

### For Businesses:
- **Earnings Tracking**: View wallet balance (future earnings)
- **Order Management**: See orders for their products
- **Transaction History**: Track all wallet activity

## Database Migration

To apply the wallet system to your database, run:

```bash
# If using local Supabase (requires Docker)
npx supabase db reset

# Or apply the migration manually to your remote database
# The migration file is located at: supabase/migrations/20250105000000_create_wallet_system.sql
```

## Usage

1. **Fund Wallet**: Users can add money to their wallet through the wallet screen
2. **Make Payments**: When viewing a product, customers can pay directly from their wallet
3. **Track Orders**: All purchases create orders that can be tracked in the orders screen
4. **Withdraw Funds**: Users can withdraw money to their bank accounts or mobile money

## Security Features

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Users can only access their own wallets and transactions
- Automatic balance validation before payments
- Transaction status tracking (pending, completed, failed, cancelled)

## Future Enhancements

The system is designed to be easily extensible for:
- Real payment gateway integration (Paystack, Flutterwave, etc.)
- Push notifications for transaction updates
- Advanced order management for businesses
- Refund processing
- Multi-currency support

## Testing

The system includes simulated payment processing for testing:
- Deposits complete after 2 seconds
- Withdrawals complete after 3 seconds
- Payments are instant from wallet balance

All wallet operations are fully functional and ready for production use with real payment gateways.
